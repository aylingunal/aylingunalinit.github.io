  <p>
    Erva drives to Didim, Turkey, alone.

  </p>
  <p>
    On both sides of the highway are massive expanses of dirt plains that fold under scrubby green hills. Fields of yellow -- crops and animals roam, tiny as specks of dust from the highway -- surround tiny, colorful houses of red and brown and blue, and they fade to gray as they curve up into mountains. The mountains crouch low in the distance wherever one looks, always just a little wispy underneath a thin layer of clouds. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The music on the radio crackles. Erva turns it off and counts the number of mosques she passes. She loses track as she rolls into a gas station. Two men in uniform trot up to her windows. 

  </p>

  <p>
    "Abla, Merhaba," the one with the bigger moustache says. "Just a fill-up?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "Yes, thank you," Erva says.

  </p>
  <p>
    The men begin to yell at each other in the same way soccer players on the field will alert each other to their positions and to potential tactical moves -- lots of "Ali, get over here and hold this up!" and "Take care of that gentleman over there!" The attendants buzz like bees around her car. 
  </p>
  <p>
    "So, where are you headed?" one of the younger attendants asks. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Didim," she says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah! Visiting or heading home?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Just visiting."

  </p>
  <p>
    "Well, you will enjoy it," he says. "The weather is great, and they have great beaches." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Where are you coming from? I hear some accent," the moustached attendant says. Then he shakes his head. "Hold on, let us guess! Also, cash or card?"
  </p>
  <p>
    "Card, please," Erva says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "German," says the younger attendant. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "British," moustache says. "It must be British. I'm confident." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "United States," Erva says somberly.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah! So close," moustache says. "Abla, thank you. Would you like some tea?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh, no thank you," Erva says, but moustache is already turning towards his inferior, shaking his head.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Did you not offer our friend some tea yet? For shame," he says. The younger attendant shakes his head in agreement and opens his mouth to apologize. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "No, no, it's okay!" Erva says. "I need to go, anyways." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Just one cup of tea! No? Well, I suppose you're right if you want to make good time to Didim." The moustache man gives the roof of her car a pat. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Have a safe trip," the younger attendant says. Erva smiles at the men, brothers to her in this pocket of time and space. She and the rental car begin the final leg of the trip to Didim just as the sun begins to set.

  </p>
  <p>
    It has been over a decade since she's been on this road. The last time was when she was twelve, maybe. This is not the first summer she spends without seeing Baba once, but it is the first one she visits Turkey without him. The radio crackles with staticky Turkish pop music and she turns it off. The rental car she drives smells like cigarettes and pine air freshener, same as it did such a long time ago. The passenger seat is empty, save for a crumpled paper bag of cheesy pretzels from the airport. It doesn't have much to say to her -- maybe the car ride to Didim isn't too different without her father sitting beside her. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva slows the rental car to a crawl as the road begins to wind up and into the mountains. It's a lonely and treacherous path that slides closer and further from steep, stony drops along the cliff sides, like a curious child periodically wandering too close to a ledge and running back to safety again. She cuts the engine after just a few minutes of driving in this narrow section of road. There are just a few yards of dirt and a handful of wooden spokes driven into the ground between the road and a cliffside. She puts a water bottle to her mouth and a few drops splash onto her shirt. 

  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, he used to stop the car somewhere along this road and step out of the car, but not because he feared accidentally driving off the face of a mountain. He would ignore Erva's pleas to stay close, and would walk right up to the cliffside to look up at the starry sky. In the dark, all Erva would see was his silhouette, flickering in and out darkness as clouds trickled over the moon. With every flicker, Erva would believe her father to have wholly disappeared from sight, having accidentally fallen to a brutal death. All in the name of getting a better look at a clear night sky. 

  </p>
  <p>
    He never did fall. He never even looked down.

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva screws the cap back onto the water bottle and pops a bite of pretzel into her mouth. If Baba were here, he would tell her that she is a coward, and to get a move on. 

  </p>
  <p>
    But he is in another country at the moment. Erva restarts the engine and inches along the road until it begins to decline and widen, and eventually she reaches a main road and the mountain once more becomes a ghostly set of lines in the horizon. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>
  <p>
    At 10PM, she rolls into Didim. The highway merges into a local road that runs along a beachside cliff. The local road becomes narrow and gravely, and she catches the faintest whiff of recognition as she turns onto a short drive lined with trees that dangle red flowers. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The hotel is a tall building, checkered white and brown to separate the balconies of different rooms. The name of the hotel is splayed on a large sign that extends across the entrance, and on the front porch, a group of men in soccer jerseys and jean shorts smoke and drink tea. A woman in platform sandals and bleached blonde hair emerges from inside with a giant bowl of watermelon. She's the first to notice Erva's car idling down the road. She steps off of the porch and waves. The men behind her crank their necks back to see. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva's hands flutter over the wheel in a brief panic. The creeper, caught. She steadies one hand over the gearshift and grips, and then moves very slowly forward to come to a stop in front of the hotel. A highly attentive audience greets her with stares and smiles. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Merhaba!" the woman says. "Can I help you?"  

  </p>
  <p>
    "Selam!" Erva calls through the window. "I have a room for the night. Where can I park?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Welcome! You can park right around there." 

  </p>
  <p>
    He gestures around the side of the building but one of his comrades has already hopped down the stairs to the front of her car. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Come right along here," he says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Omer will show you!" the man from the porch says. "Then come in, and we'll check you in. It's good to see you! How's your father? Would you take any tea?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Um, no thank you!" Erva shouts as she drives slowly beside Omer, who jogs her around the building to the lot. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She parks and Omer moves to her trunk. "Do you have any suitcases or bags?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Just one small one in the back!" she calls through the passenger window. She opens up the door to the backseat and swings her suitcase outside.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Let me grab that for you," Omer says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh, no, I couldn't, it's so small," Erva says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Please, I insist!" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "No, no, it's really alright," Erva says. "Thank you!" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Omer raises his eyebrows. "Okay, if you're sure!" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Omer escorts her to the front desk, behind which a very small boxy TV plays a pixelated soccer game. One of the men from the porch appears, takes a good long look at the state of the game, and then turns his attention to Erva. Erva drops her suitcase to the ground, and Omer promptly picks it up.

  </p>
  <p>
    "You've already paid," the man behind the desk notes, checking a computer. "Great! We have a great pool out back, very clean and large. My name is Cem. If you have any problems, let me know. If I'm not here, the front desk is staffed 24 hours a day so Omer or Bulent or one of the other men will help you. Breakfast and dinner can be included for an extra 10TL a day. Breakfast is tea, coffee, fresh pastries, jams, butter, cheese, and a daily selection of fruit, and is from 8AM to 10AM. The dinner menu is announced at 5PM daily, and dinner is served 6PM to 8PM.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Sounds good?" he asks. "Good! Here is your key, and Omer will take you up to your room. Please, once you're settled in, consider coming down to join us for some tea." 

  </p>
  <p>
    He points to the porch. "My wife, my nephew, a few neighbors. We also have watermelon and some leftover bogrek from dinner." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I'm coming from the United States," Erva says in Turkish that her father would undoubtedly dub as no good. "So, the time. You see. The time. Everyone there has been sleeping for seven hours." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "The time difference?" the man confirms. "Of course, please rest! We would love to hear how your family is doing soon. No matter, another night. Please say hello to him from Cem and Nilay!"

  </p>
  <p>
    In the elevator, Erva nods at the suitcase that Omer holds onto. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "So," she says. "In the end, it's yours." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Omer smiles. "If only you had given it to me in the first place, we wouldn't have gone through so much trouble!" 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>  <p>
    Erva wakes up feeling refreshed and ready for the day. Unfortunately, it is only around 3:30AM. She lays awake in bed, listening to the sounds of dying parties outside, heavy bass music that rumbles alone without the shouts and laughter of a crowd. The electric companies in Didim have special task forces dedicated solely to the stereo systems of bars by the beach -- the music never stops, does it? It's something that Erva remembers from her childhood days spent in the city, and the nostalgia numbs any bother she has with the incessant, upbeat sounds of pop music playing in the distance as she tries to fall asleep. 

  </p>
  <p>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    No, her real issue is this bed. It's too squashy, and these pillows are too large. She tries tossing them to the side and putting her head directly down on the bed. No, this is awkward. She puts an arm under her neck. That is too warm. 

  </p>
  <p>
    There was a summer they spent in Didim in their little apartment just around the corner from this hotel. Erva couldn't sleep for the first few nights and was irritable during the day. One late night, she woke up and decided to try to read a book she had brought on the trip. She turned her lamp on and a few minutes later, her father was at her door. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Go to sleep," he grunted. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I can't," Erva whispered, although there was no one to wake up. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I said, go to sleep."

  </p>
  <p>
    In a rare moment of rebellion, Erva waited a few minutes before turning her lamp on again and opening her book to the dog-eared page. The lamplight didn't shine so far into the hallway that it could possibly bother her father -- logically, there was no problem.

  </p>
  <p>
    The door opened and Erva's father walked in. Erva shoved the book underneath the covers and under her legs, and as she tried to say "Sorry" her father grabbed her arm and squeezed. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "What did I say?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    The white curtains fluttered delicately in an incoming breeze as though a ghost had crept in through the window. The room smelled like flowers and salt. 

  </p>
  <p>
    He dropped her arm and walked back out of the room, leaving the door open behind him. Erva laid her back straight down and closed her eyes. The book under her covers was bulky and one hard corner poked into her thigh, but she didn't adjust right away. She didn't pull the book out until the morning, when she woke up to find that her father had already gone down to his beach to swim. While he was gone, she dropped the book into her bedside drawer and went into the kitchen to eat breakfast and watch the morning news, which discussed last night's World Cup game.

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva wonders whatever happened to that book. It wasn't particularly interesting--or maybe it had lost its flavor midway through--and she had never opened up her drawer to pick it up again. Would her father tell her, if she asks? 

  </p>
  <p>
    After finding what seems to be the perfect position, a mosquito descends into her ear, whining in warning of its imminent landing. Erva slaps the side of her head, and then checks her palm: disappointingly bloodless. She flaps her hands around her ears as she stands up and makes her way to the window to close it. The room goes silent, and very warm soon after. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>  <p>
    "Good morning," says an unfamiliar man sitting at the front desk the next morning. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Good morning," Erva says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    It's 8AM. Beach towns are filled with people who lounge, but they don't come in until later in the afternoon. There's an early one -- a salt-and-pepper man in a clean button-down shirt on his porch, smoking a morning cigarette with a bowl of olives and tomatoes in front of him, lazily watching the street and the sky. In the afternoon, surely there will be more of his kin, leaning against buildings and motorcycles, striking up conversations with the shop owners that they know, smoking cigarettes under the shade of streetside ice cream vendors. 

  </p>
  <p>
    For now, the few people who are outside are people who are going somewhere. There is a purpose to the bag in their hands -- some are coming from the supermarket carrying groceries, others are carrying linen packs streaked in sand as they come back from early morning swims. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Baba used to go to the beach in the morning when Erva slept in. Not the main one Leyla would take her to sometimes--that one would become quickly bloated with tourists during the day, rented beach towels and rainbow umbrellas set down inches away from each other in the sand. No, his beach is the special one, the one that not many seem to know about. Erva has never been there and when she asked him for directions before her flight to Turkey, he told her over the phone. In the airport, she pulled out a stray pen and paper and asked him to pause as she wrote each word down. Surprisingly, he did so patiently.

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva finds the beach as per her father's directions. It's not as difficult as she thought it would be to find. The route comes naturally to her, and the sights are familiar -- there is the overly weedy yard of a corner house behind a rusted fence, there is the kiddie roller coaster with ladybug cars in the beachside theme park further down the road. The theme park looks like a discarded toy in the daylight, large, pinkish, plastic, and perfectly still. There is the neighborhood dumpster, and there is the occasional cat that wanders past. Each cat gives Erva one meaningful look, almost like recognition, before slinking behind a bush and disappearing.

  </p>
  <p>
    Her beach. Passed down from father to daughter. The sentiment is helped by the fact that she sees no one else at this tiny, secluded place as she first heads down the stony stairway from atop the cliff to the water. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The water is cold against her ankles, but feels like a divine embrace as it closes over her head. She doesn't open her head, but floats with her back to the sun, pawing blindly at the wet sandy floor with her fingers to push herself forward. The saltwater burns her eyes even though they're closed, and her calves prick with the pin size bites of tiny fish. The sound of the water fills her ears. It's lovely. She listens to the waves. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>
  <p>
    Erva walks up towards the hotel where Cem, the hotel owner, waves. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva hanim, good morning!" he calls. He stands on the front porch drinking tea from a tiny glass cup. Even under the shade of the trees and the extended porch canopy, the thin crust of dried salt and sand on Erva's skin begins to crack because of how intensely she sweats. She blots her forehead with the neck of her shirt, wondering how Cem can sit comfortably in an unbuttoned sweater vest over a button down shirt and full length khaki pants. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Good morning!" Erva says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Did you sleep well? Are you enjoying your stay so far? Is there anything I can do for you?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "I slept well, the room is comfortable," Erva says. "Thank you." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "That's very good to hear," Cem says. "Would you like some tea?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I haven't, ah, given money yet," Erva says. "For food in the morning." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Cem waves away her terrible Turkish and with the same hand, gestures for her to take a seat at one of the lawn chairs on the porch. Erva's embarrassment over butchering this man's native language turns to a burning sense of responsibility for recompense and she sits down. "No need. Omer's bringing out more tea, I'll ask him to bring one more cup. Omer!"

  </p>
  <p>
    He knocks on the window behind them. "Another cup! Erva hanim is joining us!" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "So, Erva," he says, settling comfortably into his chair. "You went to the beach this morning?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "Yes," Erva says. "If I go this early, there's no one else there. It's beautiful." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Of course, of course," Cem says. "You know, we get many British tourists here, and all of them go to the big beach down the road, do you know the one? It's just across the Migros. They all go there, pay for chairs and umbrellas, and become red all over -- the faces are just, boof! -- and then come back for dinner. Is that the one you go to?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "When I was little, I went there in the afternoons with an abla," Erva says. "This morning, I went to a small place. It's next to the…" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva twists her hands around. "I can't remember the word. Like a lot of cars, in the air…"

  </p>
  <p>
    She mimics the motion of a wave with her hand. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah! Lunaparki?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Yes, yes, lunapark!" Erva says, leaning forward. "Yes. It's by there." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "You know, Omer knows some English. If he comes out here, you can try speaking with him," the old man says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Years ago, it was her father growling at her to "Say it correctly." when she tried to speak his native tongue in their house in the United States to tell him thank you for cooking a delicious dinner. She stood at the edge of the kitchen island, face beginning to flush, the homework in her room forgotten. She tried again. He shook his head and his voice a lick angrier: "Say it correctly." And so they went back and forth, the anger in his voice growing like the tongues of a flame leaping higher into the sky, until Erva managed to say thank you correctly. He said it back to her, and turned to the dishwasher. Erva took small, slow steps to leave the kitchen, and then ran to her bedroom once out of sight. 

  </p>
  <p>
    If he were sitting here on this porch beside her, she doubts she would have exchanged more than a few greetings with the hotel staff. He would be the one sitting out on the porch, reminiscing with these men that he has inherited as friends from his father before him.

  </p>
  <p>
    Today, this stranger kindly attempts to offer some comfort for Erva, who is far from home. Erva smiles at Cem. "Maybe later." 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>  <p>
    In the evening, Erva visits the boardwalk. She takes the same route she would to go to her father's beach, except this time takes a left to turn onto a main road. There's a low stone wall that extends alongside the side of the road, and on the other side is a rocky hillside that eventually dips into the ocean below. At 8PM, the sun is in the process of slowly sinking into the ocean at the horizon line, leaving a lovely burnt orange flare in its wake. The Greek Islands are translucent over the ocean, just lightly drawn outlines somewhere far out. Closer to the boardwalk, there's an unmoving circle in the sky of the neon pink lights of a ferris wheel. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The road slopes downward and eventually winds into the storefronts that open up the boardwalk. The smell of salt is everywhere: the crunchy seaweed washed up on the beach, the kebabs on their spinning poles, the grilled fish sandwiches with steak fries on the side. 

  </p>
  <p>
    At the Kar Cicegi restaurant, Erva orders iced tea and lahmacun. Years ago, she sat in the same restaurant and sulked.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Why don't you get ayran?" asked Leyla. She was the woman from next door that babysat Erva once upon a time when Erva was small. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I don't like it," Erva told her.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Have you ever tried it?" she asked incredulously.

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva looked over her shoulder at the ocean, just past the edge of the boardwalk. An ice cream vendor with a red hat in the shape of a bucket with a golden tassel swinging atop it stood there. With tongs the length of his own arms, he took scoops of ice cream and popped them into cones and dipped them in chocolate and nuts. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva, have you ever tried ayran?" Leyla asked again, this time very seriously. 
 
  </p>
  <p>
    "No," she muttered, now looking down at her plaid pink bermuda shorts, smudged with sand. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Well then, how can you say you don't like it?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "It looks weird," she said. "It's too watery to be yogurt, and it's too thick to be a drink." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Those are not good reasons to not try it," Leyla said, and put a finger in the air. "Kardes, can we get another ayran?"

  </p>
  <p>
    A plastic cup with a crinkly aluminum top was placed on the tabletop and Erva looked away in disgust. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Just try it," Leyla said. "I don't ask anything more from you but to try it, and you know me! I would never ask anything from you that I don't think would be good for you or that you would like."

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla, nearly sixty years old, was thin and covered in sharp angles. Her collarbones poked out from underneath her flowery button-down and her knees were tanned and knobby. She wore pink lipstick -- the same shade every day -- and dyed her hair a dark, rust red. She pushed the cup of ayran closer to Erva's side of the table. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Go ahead," she said. "It won't hurt you to just try it." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva stayed very still and kept her eyes pointed at the folded napkin in front of her. If she didn't move, she would eventually become so small and disintegrate into a nothing being, a thing that wouldn't be able to drink ayran, or anything else for that matter. If she could just cease to exist for that moment, Leyla abla would become uninterested, like a toothy animal reviewing what may or may not be prey playing dead. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva, why won't you try the ayran? Try it for me," the woman implored. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Allah, please, Erva said in her head without blinking – if she blinked, she would unwillingly push out the excess tears beginning to gather in her eyes. Please please please, I will never ask for anything ever again, I just don't want ayran. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla, oblivious, tried to ask her once more. "Go ahead, Erva, the nice server brought over this ayran, just go ahead and try it." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva began to cry. And because she had been holding them back, they flooded forward in one big splash across her nose. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva? Are you okay?" Leyla asked. "My girl, what is wrong? Are you feeling okay?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva cried harder. A young couple at the neighboring table looked over and the woman asked, "Is she okay?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla shook her head, flabbergasted. "I don't understand what happened. She's just crying for some reason." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva, a small speck floating further and further away from Earth, covered her eyes with her hands. Leyla tried to pull her hands away from her face. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Let me see your face," she said, swiping her thumbs underneath Erva's eyes. "What's wrong? Look me in the eyes. What's wrong?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva had no other choice but to return to reality and look Leyla in the face. With snot running in salty streams along the edges of her lips, she whispered, "I don't want to drink ayran." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla stared at her for a moment with her mouth slightly open. Erva could see the pale, wrinkled underbelly of her painted pink lips. Then Leyla began to laugh and Erva looked away again, back towards the ice cream vendor. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "What an incredibly silly thing to cry about," Leyla chuckled. "I didn't know you would cry! Fine then, don't drink it, if you're going to be so dramatic." 

  </p>
  <p>
    The couple at the table over smiled and nodded and went back to their own lunch. At some point, a server quietly insisted that something was "On us, don't worry, don't worry" as Leyla tried to argue, and a Magnum ice cream bar quietly appeared in front of Erva. 

  </p>
  <p>
    In the evening, Leyla dropped her back off at her father's apartment unit. Erva ran inside without saying a word and into the living room. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "She's a weird little girl," Leyla said. "She started crying at the restaurant instead of just drinking some ayran." 

  </p>
  <p>
    A pause.  "I don't know! What a strange little girl you have!" Laughter. She didn't mean it in a bad way. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Baba, coolly: "She won't do what she doesn't want to do. Don't force her into anything." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva's chest went tight. He knew. He didn't even have to have been there to know what the witch from next door had done to her. There weren't many moments he tried or even pretended to be empathetic to her--or anyone, really--but this was one of them. Her shoulders had been bunched up tightly around her neck, and she allowed them to relax down. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I didn't force her into anything," Leyla laughed. "She just didn't want to drink ayran, so she cried about it! How silly."

  </p>
  <p>
    Empty chatter and a round of "Goodnight"s and the door closed. Baba came into the living room and turned on a football game. He lowered the volume and Erva stared at her knees. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "You don't have to do anything you don't want to do," Baba said. "But ayran is good and you should try it sometime." His voice turned sharp. "Let this be the last time you cry in public."

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva, still looking at her knees, nodded. The volume was increased and they watched a game of football until Erva's eyes began to hurt and she had to go to bed. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The next morning, her father dropped her off at Leyla's door once again. 

  </p>
  <p>
    It took years for Erva to even bother to taste ayran, and she only did it in the safety of the cafeteria of an international grocery store near her apartment in the States. It was the same brand as the one Leyla had offered her years ago. She poked a straw through the lid and before taking a sip, spun on her heel to give the cafeteria a once-over. No one else but a man wearing a sweater vest, drinking a black coffee over a plastic box of tuna salad, staring forcefully at the newspaper laid out in front of him. Her corner table, stained with mustard and chipped along the edges, was sufficiently private. She drank a little bit, and then downed the full cup soon after. She liked it. It was delicious. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She will not order it at the Kar Cicegi tonight, though, as she watches the sun slide down the darkening sky. Her iced tea is peach flavored and cold and is just fine as a complement to the slightly burned lahmacun served to her. After finishing dinner, she walks down the boardwalk, telling herself that on a different day, she'll get ice cream.

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>
  <p>
    In the morning, Erva wakes up early. The jetlag has nothing to do with it. Her stomach, full of butterflies and acid, gives her a cramp and her eyes open at 5:30AM. She shuts them. There is a lot to do today. Today is the only day that really matters during this trip.

  </p>
  <p>
    At 6AM, she gives up trying to sleep and crawls over to the other side of the bed where her suitcase sits open on the ground. The clothing she has brought on the trip hangs neatly in the hotel room closet, so the single item still residing inside the suitcase looks like the single actor on a large, dark stage: an envelope, slightly bent out of shape. It's barely sealed, having been haphazardly slicked shut with a wet pinkie multiple times.

  </p>
  <p>
    "I also sent it in email format," Erva's father had said helpfully on the phone when Erva first received the physical note in her mailbox. "In case you lose it." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I haven't lost anything while traveling in years, Baba," Erva sighed. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I'm going to be busy and I won't be able to give you all of the information in this much detail at the drop of a hat. Don't lose it." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I won't," she said. "It's important. I wouldn't lose it." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I can't just fly over there on a whim, you know," Erva's father lectured on. Erva sunk into her living room sofa as her knuckles grew white around the phone. "You are the one that's going to talk to Leyla. You are the one that's going to pick up the keys. You are the last person to go into the apartment."

  </p>
  <p>
    "What about the demolition guys?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "What?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "I'm not going to be the last person in there. One of them will be." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva, don't be funny." 

  </p>
  <p>
    In Turkish, Erva said: "I'm saying real. I can do this." 
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Her father made a noise that could have been a laugh. "You should brush up on your Turkish before you go."

  </p>
  <p>
    In the hotel room, she opens up the envelope again, careful not to tear the paper. It bothers her that her father doesn't take her seriously when she tries, and then takes her too seriously when she doesn't. It bothers her that whenever they speak, it's like she's communicating with someone through a translator; the gist of the message is there, but there's no perception of tone. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The note inside the envelope is a plain piece of printer paper and contains a list of instructions her father has written down. His handwriting is loopy and expressive. The first few lines dictate a visit to the local bank. There's an account that money must be withdrawn from: cash for Leyla. Erva doesn't know who the account belongs to or why she is meant to hand over a small trust fund to an old babysitter, but her father is an expensive phone call away from understanding why.

  </p>
  <p>
    The last few lines contain the address of the apartment and the unit that belongs to Leyla. There is a date and time marked down as well, for when Leyla will expect Erva to arrive at the apartment. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She shuts the note inside the envelope and slicks it shut. The date is today. 

  </p>
  <p>
    A few hours later, Erva gets dressed and walks into the lobby of the hotel. She passes by an open-roof room where a few hotel guests lather butter onto bread and peel oranges onto their plates. Omer, the hotel staff member who had taken her suitcase up to her room a few nights ago sits in a corner with a young couple. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva hanim, good morning," he greets her from across the room. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Good morning," she calls back. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "What are you planning to do today?"

  </p>
  <p>
    Her father's envelope pokes her thigh through the inner flap of her pocket. She smiles. "I'm going to be a tourist."

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh!" says the young woman sitting beside Omer. She gestures to Omer. "Where are you going? We're here on vacation, and he's been giving us some advice on good places to eat." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "There's a great little place a few miles north, very authentic," Omer says, nodding. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah ah," Erva says, shaking her head. "Beach, and then Apollo's Temple." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "That sounds excellent," Omer says. "There is a fee to get into Apollo's Temple. But there are great views from the back, past the ticket office." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Let us know how it goes," the young woman calls. "Perhaps we'll see you at dinner?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva nods. The woman tells her her name, as well her fiance's name. The couple and Omer wave as Erva steps away. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    ***
  </p>  <p>
    True to her word, Erva spends an hour traveling to and from Apollo's Temple. The bus takes her up a winding, bumpy dirt road and deposits her at a plateau. In the distance, the ruins rise up from the ground. The stone pillars and the monuments they continue to display are surprisingly tall. 

  </p>
  <p>
    There is no protection at all from the sun and the sunscreen on her eyes mixes in with sweat to form a webby white sheen along her arms. She passes the ticket office and begins to walk along the fence towards the back of the historical site. Aside from rock and wood and one very small mosque, there's not much. 

  </p>
  <p>
    There's a small pile of broken rocks that reach the top of the fence, and she climbs up to look out onto the remnants of an ancient city. Omer was right. The view from the back is stunning. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She spots something carved into flat stone, something different from the intricate carving work that decorates the columns that once held up full city buildings. It's a portrait. Erva leans forward. At her angle, the portrait is almost perfectly sideways but she catches enough of a glimpse to see the woman's unsmiling face, cut in half by a broken canvas. 

  </p>
  <p>
    On her way back to the bus stop, she stops by the ticket office. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "There is a portrait of a woman, all the way over there," Erva says. The man inside the booth squints at her. "Who is that?"
 
  </p>
  <p>
    "Do you mean Medusa?"

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva smiles and nods. "Thank you." 

  </p>
  <p>
    The bus takes her back to downtown Didim, where she gets lunch. She gets a side of yogurt with her kebab and downs two whole bottles of water, despite knowing she will have to pay extra. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The time written down on the envelope in her pocket draws nearer and nearer. Erva goes to the bank to withdraw the funds her father had asked her to. The process is surprisingly quick, and Erva soon has an additional envelope in her pocket, this one much crisper and fatter than the other. 

  </p>
  <p>
    From downtown, Erva walks up and down the street mindlessly window shopping until one of the city minibuses appears, chugging and huffing exhaust all the way down to its stop. She drops 10TL into the driver's hand. He smokes a cigarette and wears a wifebeater, and the bus jolts off before Erva has a chance to sit down. A pair of stuffed dominoes swing dangerously from the rearview mirror as the bus starts and stops and careens around corners. Erva clutches the upholstery of the seat in front of her in order to not get thrown into the aisle, where sweaty British tourists talk about where they should go to get beers. A few Turkish people try yelling at the bus driver occasionally to ask how long it would take to get to stop 42, or to stop 13, and he never responds. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Abi, do you hear us back here?" comes one irritated voice from the middle of the bus. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The bus driver pretends he can't hear them. Through the window, Erva sees her stop coming up. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "My stop, my stop," she says, eyeing the aisle, packed with people. No one seems to pay attention. Her voice rises in a squeaky panic. "Can you stop? Hey, abi, can you stop?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    The bus breaks abruptly, launching every passenger an inch or two up and forward into the air. Someone swears, and Erva squeezes her way to the front of the bus, where she pops out and onto the sidewalk. Before she can say thank you, the doors close behind her and the bus takes off. 

  </p>
  <p>
    In front of the bus stop is a short row of houses. Around the corner is the apartment building her father owns and is planning to sell to some hotel chain Erva doesn't know the name of. It's where Leyla lives and now waits for Erva to take away the keys to her home. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She knows that the bus will return in seven minutes to this stop. She considers turning her back on the neighborhood behind her and plopping down onto the curb to wait. The consequent events are predictable and appealing: she boards the bus and gets off at a beach or a local restaurant, she goes home, she ignores the missed calls from her father, she flies back to her quiet apartment in the United States. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Her brain goes further: obviously, she can't just not go to the apartment building. Perhaps if she never had even volunteered, snatching up the opportunity from an offhand comment from her father three months ago, she wouldn't be standing here at this moment saddled with this responsibility. It wasn't like she was the only person capable of walking over and being handed a set of dusty old keys. If she just hadn't heard him sigh and grumble about having to fly out to Turkey in the middle of a merger or whatever big new project had come up at work, if she just hadn't let her mouth open up and say that she actually would have plenty of time in the summer since her fellowship would end by then.

  </p>
  <p>
    Too bad retrospect lends itself to nothing but regret. Erva walks away from the bus stop and to the apartment building. In the alcove around the front door, Leyla sits in a plastic white chair with a bottle of ayran and a comically large pair of sunglasses on her face. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Erva!" Leyla calls out. Her voice is raspy. It takes Erva by surprise. A handful of memories spring into her mind; at the core of all of them is an image of Leyla taking drag upon drag of a cigarette. On the balcony, at the Kar Cicegi table, on the street waiting for a bus, on the beach where she left ashy stubs to cool in the sand. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Merhaba!" Erva says. "Leyla, how are you?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I can't believe how much you have grown," Leyla says, looking Erva up and down as Erva reaches the front steps. "The last time I saw you, you were just this tall.

  </p>
  <p>
    "How was your flight? When did you arrive?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "Two days ago."

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh, well," Leyla huffs. "Why didn't your father tell me so? We could have had dinner, I could have walked you around the boardwalk. Have you ever seen the flowers they grow in the beer garden? On the boardwalk? I could have shown you."

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh," Erva says. She looks at the spot just between Leyla's eyes. "Well, I remember Didim well. I don't need a tour. But no, I was too young to drink beer so I never saw the flowers."

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla stands up to embrace Erva. They kiss each other's cheeks and Erva catches the whiff of cigarettes and citrusy perfume. The smell is lovely and for a short moment, Erva remembers what it was like to be a child in Turkey; to feel a whole and inherent sense of belonging. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla grips Erva's shoulders tightly with thin, bony fingers. When she steps back to hold Erva at a distance, her wonderful scent retreats with her. Erva can see that Leyla looks even thinner than she was. She smiles at Erva with the same shade of pink lipstick that she wore decades ago. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "How are you now? Are you still in school, or are you working?" Leyla asks and turns towards the front door. "Come inside!" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Um, yes," Erva says. "Leyla, is there somewhere to sit inside?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "Of course, of course, what are you even saying?" Leyla says, sticking a key into the front door. A key that should be retired by now. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I, um," Erva flounders, taking a step forward and stopping. "Sh… Um…" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva decides to give up on any preliminary critiques. The concern she has might be based on nothing. Maybe there's a final old plastic table and set of chairs in what used to be Leyla's unit, the only pieces of furniture left and easily dispensable. She could even help Leyla, who looks particularly frail and now holds a walking stick, take them outside and put them on the curb. She could call Cem, from the hotel -- the hotel staff might appreciate an extra old table and chairs for the front porch. 

  </p>
  <p>
    She follows Leyla up the stone steps to the first floor, where Leyla inserts a second key into her unit's door. Erva bites hard down on her lower lip and tastes salt in her mouth. Leyla gives the door a concentrated shove in a spot just above the keyhole and it gives way into a fully furnished living room. Erva's stomach clenches and she steps over the threshold. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "My shoes," Erva says. "I'll leave them here at the door?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "It doesn't matter," Leyla says, tapping the floor with the toe of her sneaker. She's in the kitchen and turns the stove on in order to boil a kettle of water. The glassdoor cabinets above the sink are stacked with plates and bowls. There's a small wooden table just beyond the counter, surrounded by several blue chair stools. Picture frames of black and white landscapes hang from the peeling yellow wallpaper, and there's a rug in the kitchen and peeking out from the living room. The entire apartment is filled with sunlight: it streams through the gauzy white curtains around the living room windows. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva's head begins to hurt. What a complete and utter disaster. 

  </p>
  <p>
    It's not her fault. Her father should have been the one to tell Leyla that she was supposed to have moved out weeks ago. Regardless, she is the one that is here now, standing in the fully furnished apartment. She is the one that has to deal with it. The building has to come down anyways. Maybe it will all be okay if she can just get Leyla and several of her most prized possessions out in time for demolition. The rubble will be cleared whether or not it contains broken table legs and dinner plates.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Go on, sit down wherever you would like to," Leyla says. Erva trudges over to the living room, where she can see the balcony stained with fallen mulberries through the curtains. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Your tea is ready," Leyla calls from the kitchen. "Don't let an old, pained woman serve you everything, Erva. Come get your tea and serve us both some cookies -- check the cabinet on the left." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva stands up and goes to the kitchen to pull out a tin of cookies from the left cabinet and pick up her cup and saucer. Her frustration is growing behind her eyelids. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Thank you, Erva," Leyla says as they sit down at the living room coffee table. "Now, tell me, how are you? What are you doing these days all the way over there in America?"

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla's face is shining painfully. Erva takes an overly large swallow of her tea and it burns her tongue. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Last year I quit work," she says. "I want to go to law school so I am planning on that now." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Ah! Law! I remember you used to love reading," Leyla laughs. "You had such thick books for a ten year old. I remember telling your dad that you needed to get out of those books and out into the world to learn something real. But I suppose it worked out for you, in the end, all that reading. You know I used to work with lawyers? I know something about how that profession works. If you ever have any questions, you let me know." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva smiles weakly.

  </p>
  <p>
    "What else? Tell me about your friends. Where will you go for school?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "My friends are good," Erva says. "I haven't applied yet, but I want Columbia. In New York." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Oh, New York, how nice," Leyla says. "That is somewhere I have never been. I have visited San Diego and Chicago but never New York. While you're there, I can visit and we can explore the city together!"

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva smiles and nods. "Leyla, one thing I need to talk to you about." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Have you had a cookie? This is the kind you loved when you were just this tall!" Leyla holds her hand out to demonstrate once more. "It's the one with chocolate cream in the middle. You loved them. Eat one." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I don't want it, really," Erva tries, but the woman fishes a cookie out of its cylindrical tin and holds it in front of Erva anyways. Erva picks it up and crumbles off a piece of the edge to pop in her mouth. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "No, no, like this," Leyla says. She snaps a fresh one in half and dunks it into her tea. "Delicious. This is how we used to eat them all the time, when I was a child." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Leyla, really. Baba sent me here." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "You're too skinny," Leyla says. "There's a big bowl of green beans in the fridge, would you like some of that?"

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva stares as Leyla stands up to slowly make her way back to the kitchen. Leyla rummages through the kitchen, and Erva wonders if she should call her father. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Well, there's not as much as I thought there was," Leyla calls out, placing the bowl on the kitchen counter. "But have as much as you would like! Oh, here's something." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla turns around and holds out a plastic cup of ayran. "You used to love ayran, didn't you? I've heard there's no such thing in America." 

  </p>
  <p>
    She turns to the kitchen counter and plucks a dewy glass from the drying rack. With a fork, she punctures the aluminum cap of the drink and pours it into the glass. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Here you go," she says. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, Babacim, if you could see me now! Erva stands up, walks to the kitchen, picks up the glass, and brings it back with her to her chair. No tears shed. She sets the glass down, making her mind up to not take a single sip. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "How is it?" Leyla asks.

  </p>
  <p>
    "Leyla, why are you still here?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla turns around. "What do you mean?"

  </p>
  <p>
    "Didn't you hear anything from my father?"

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla shakes her head, not in any sort of affirmative answer but as though she's trying to clear her head. She smiles again and sits down at the kitchen table. "Yes."

  </p>
  <p>
    "But you're still here."

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla continues to smile. "Yes." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Why?" 

  </p>
  <p>
    "This is my house." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva laughs. "No, it's not." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Yes, it is." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva's head feels as though it is floating a few inches above the rest of her body. "Leyla, my dad is going to demolish the building. You can't be here." 

  </p>
  <p>
    The switch flips and Leyla's eyebrows screw down. "This is my house. You can't just take this away from me. I have lived here for thirty something years. I don't bother anyone and I pay rent."

  </p>
  <p>
    Her face hardens a shade more and she looks towards the window. "I took care of you for years for no cost at all to your father. I never asked for anything in return but he certainly never thought to give anything. And now he just wants to take something from me again." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva stares at the table in front of her. There are two cookie crumbs sitting on the edge and she glues her eyes to them. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla turns back towards Erva. "I took care of you when your father couldn't bother. And now he sends you off to kick me out of my own house. The audacity of that egotistical man." 

  </p>
  <p>
    "He didn't send me," Erva says. Her voice cracks. "I wanted to come." 

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla ignores this and makes a fist against the kitchen tabletop. She bangs down. She's too weak to make much of a noise, but Erva still flinches. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "It's my house," Leyla says again. "My house!"

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla continues to chant to herself and Erva sits on the sofa, staring at the crumbs in front of her. There's a faint ringing in her ears and a red flush in the corners of her vision, like pressure is slowly building inside of her head. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The words are all in her head. They're not jumbled; she knows what she could say to make it better. I'm sorry! It's awful to be forced to leave the place you've called home for such a long time, and by a family member, no less. But it's going to be alright, Abla. There are so many other places to stay in Didim, so many other fantastic little apartment units right by the sea. Some probably in better locations than this one -- this one is, after all, quite a walk from the Migros. Also, between you and I, Baba isn't going to retire anytime soon. I'm not sure he ever will. In any case, once the apartment is renovated to become a beautiful multi-level house, you can live here Leyla! There will always be a room in the new house for you, Leyla!

  </p>
  <p>
    It occurs to Erva that she could go beyond simple consolation. Leyla, I didn't know you felt so strongly. Let me call Baba. Maybe he can hold off on renovations. There are other properties he can retire to -- the one in Akcakoca, for example. That is also by a beach. Yes, the waves there are much more hostile and the area is often stormier than sunny but the food is great. I could try to convince him. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Even if calling her father didn't work, she would at least garner some sympathy from Leyla. Leyla could see Erva for the middle-woman she really is. Erva has no power here. She is just a lonely messenger. Not a very effective one, but here she is. Things could turn around and Leyla could pity Erva. After all, they have something in common: they're at the mercy of the same man. 

  </p>
  <p>
    For the briefest moment, Erva sees herself as the hero of not just her own story, but Leyla's. Her father realizes the efforts Erva put into fulfilling his wishes, Leyla realizes the efforts Erva put into helping her.

  </p>
  <p>
    Leyla shuffles out of sight, continuing to mumble. The bathroom door squeaks closed. Aside from the wind gently propelling the edges of the curtains high for a moment and then down again, there's no sound or movement inside the apartment. The distant sounds of cars and motorbikes honking their horns at each other and a street vendor yelling, "Watermelons!" come in through the open windows. Alone in the room, Erva brushes the cookie crumbs off of the table. 

  </p>
  <p>
    A minute passes before the toilet flushes and Leyla walks back into the living room. She breathes heavily; the panic is setting in.

  <p>
    "Please," Leyla says, suddenly grabbing Erva's hand. She squeezes it between her wrinkled fingers. "You can't just let this happen to me. Erva, I was like a mother to you." 

  </p>
  <p>
    A surge of disgust wells up within Erva. It's a surprising feeling, and before it can melt into shame, Erva latches onto it. The nerve of this random old woman to claim her mother's position. Erva had been willing to be sympathetic. She wrenches her hand away and Leyla breathes in sharply. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "I'm not doing this to you," Erva says. "Baba told you. You had time. If it wasn't me here, it would have been the police." 

  </p>
  <p>
    A moment flashes through Erva's head: Erva's father telling her that she wasn't good at communicating efficiently. "What you're actually trying to say gets lost. Everything you try to say can be said in less than ten seconds. If it's more, then the person in front of you is lost and disengaged." Erva looks into Leyla's small dark eyes and the frayed red afghan thrown against the couch behind her. Her message to Leyla is clear as day--her father might approve--and it comes as a result of her total inability to offer up distracting details that required Turkish fluency. One personal weakness alleviating another. 

  </p>
  <p>
    There's silence in the apartment. Leyla doesn't cry or look away from Erva's face. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The summer after third grade, Leyla started taking her to neighbors' houses for social calls. It usually wasn't awful. Just boring. There was a particular neighbor family that lived in a peeling beige house just a few buildings down from the apartment building. Erva liked these neighbors; the old man made cranberry lemon scones the few times she sat on the floor by the low coffee table in their living room as Leyla gossiped with his wife. 

  </p>
  <p>
    One time, the old man was at work and Leyla left Erva alone on the porch. Erva, unsupervised and bored, walked out into the sunny gravel road in front of the house. She scratched her ear and a heavyset bee buzzed loudly as it swooped into the weedy flower patches by the house. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva decided to walk down the road. She fingered a crumpled 100TL bill stashed in the far corner of her right pocket--cash given to her from her father at the beginning of the summer--as she thought hard about which turns to take to get herself to the beach. There was a burger bar she could get ice cream from. Besides, the neighbor man wasn't home and there was no mouthwatering smell of sugar and lemon drifting from the kitchen where Leyla and the wife sat around chatting, and Erva didn't particularly feel like swiping extra sugar cubes when tea would inevitably be served. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Down the gravel road she walked, a four foot child in a pink tank top and white sandals, a little sunburned around the ears. Her father walked in straight lines, with his shoulders loose and his eyes forward. Erva tried to mimic the same. Perhaps it was this confidence--so bizarrely dressed on an eight year old--that put passersby off from bothering to ask her where her parents were. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The next hour or two flew by. She bought ice cream from the burger bar, and then walked back up to the main road. She walked to her father's beach and stood at the top of the cliffside staircase, looking down into the cove. Blue and white striped towels and colorful umbrellas dotted the sand. Erva blew a chunk of hair out of her eyes and glared at the strangers down below. 

  </p>
  <p>
    And then, the part that Erva remembers most vividly: returning to the house, her fingers sticky with ice cream and her pockets jangling with change coins she didn't understand the value of, and Leyla walking out of the front door a few minutes later to say, "Erva! Oh, you're just out here. Have you just been sitting out here playing with the stray cats? You know they could scratch you, I wish you would be careful." Erva, at age eight, thought herself to be some kind of sneaky genius. 

  </p>
  <p>
    It happened more than once: Leyla going to talk to people about nothing important, Erva forgotten and left to her own devices. Erva, walking down main roads alone, licking an ice cream cone with her shoulders straight, ripe for potential kidnapping. 

  </p>
  <p>
    And the person who facilitated that wants now to equate herself to a mother. Erva looks away from a very frail looking Leyla, who shrinks further and further into herself by the minute.

  </p>
  <p>
    There is a storm of memories alighting and fizzling out in Erva's head. A shift is happening, right then and there in the living room, where negative memories of Leyla are granted higher weight and ranking than the more positive reflections. Erva used to see Leyla as an old, evil witch; a prop to substitute for her father over her childhood summers. Then she grew older and realized Leyla was not a terrible person, but rather a product of her culture; Turkish people, particularly mothers, are pushy by nature and the children of her generation grew up playing on the street with no fear of strangers, let alone abduction. Besides, perhaps it had never been Leyla's responsibility to keep Erva from the hazards of boredom. Now, Erva regresses as she silently labels Leyla a witch once more.

  </p>
  <p>
    It's a choice to do what she does, right now. Leyla isn't a villain. But Erva's anger is a cup running over, and it must all go somewhere. Leyla sits trembling on the couch, a clear dark target against the red fabric behind her. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Here is money," Erva says. She pulls out the envelope from her front pants pocket and drops it on the table. "This is from Baba. I wrote my phone number, American and Turkish, on it. My email, too. Tomorrow, I leave Didim. How much time you have… I will check with Baba. But you have to make plans to go soon." 

  </p>
  <p>
    The pressure in Erva's head falls away and she blinks. The room is quiet, and then Leyla begins to cry. She does it quietly, but obviously. Erva looks at her knees again. 

  </p>
  <p>
    A minute goes by and Erva stands up. She picks up the full glass of ayran and brings it to the kitchen sink, and then on second thought, walks to the fridge and places it inside. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "The main key," Leyla sniffles. "It's in the second drawer in the cupboard by the front door. " 

  </p>
  <p>
    Baba wants the key. Erva nods. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Goodbye, Leyla," Erva says. She walks to the front door and looks at the cupboard. She remembers hiding chocolate coins in the bottom drawer as a child. Leyla must have known of her secret stash, but she never said anything. Erva leaves the apartment without opening up the cupboard. 

  </p>

  </p>  <p>
    In the evening, she eats dinner at the Kar Cicegi restaurant once more. She walks down the boardwalk and buys herself an ice cream. The vendor she buys it from wears a red tasseled fez and grasps an empty cone with tongs the length of his legs, expertly smoothes a single scoop of vanilla ice cream onto the mouth of the cone, and offers the cone out. The cone slips through Erva's fingers as the man playfully pulls the tongs back. They do this dance for the next few seconds as a scoop of pistachio, then a dip of chocolate, then a sprinkle of nuts are applied to the cone. Erva laughs every time the cone is pulled from her hand at the last possible moment.

  </p>
  <p>
    She has never gotten a maraj-style ice cream before. The texture is chewier than normal ice cream and it is delicious. She takes a bite of ice cream and the chocolate shell around the rim of the cone. She must come again. There is a lot she hasn't tried yet, in Didim. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva eats her ice cream sitting on the beach beyond the, a few feet from the incoming waves. Before arriving in Turkey, she thought she might feel lonely being in Didim all by herself. The moon's reflection ripples gently upon the surface of the waves and the smell of cigarette smoke wafts by on a passing breeze. She never really did feel lonely, these past few days. There was too much noise. Too many people chatting in her ear all at once. 

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">

  </p>  <p>
    Early in the morning, Erva finishes packing her bag and goes down to the lobby. Omer checks her out. 

  </p>
  <p>
    "Have a safe flight," he says quietly. 

  </p>
  <p>
    The rental car begins its journey out of Didim and soon, Erva finds herself on the mountain path once more. It's different in the early morning sunlight. She can now see the rocky bottoms of the cliffs that she passed by on the way into Didim. She does not feel quite as frightened as she did coming into Didim. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Erva's phone buzzes. It's the fourth time it has buzzed since the previous evening when she sent Baba a single message before going to bed: Didn't pick up the key. He keeps trying to call her, for some reason. He won't just leave a message to ask why. Erva ignores the call. 

  </p>
  <p>
    At the top of the mountain, there are only two directions: forward and back. Erva stops the car. The sky is a perfect pixelated blue and totally free of clouds. Here, Erva looks up.
