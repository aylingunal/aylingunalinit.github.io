    Heatwaves dance and distort the road behind them like a wormhole flying by on the highway, always hovering just a mile ahead of a car zipping down through the valley. The road stretches miles ahead and slims down as it plunges into a singular dot on the horizon line. To both sides of the highway are massive expanses of dirt plains that fold under scrubby green hills. Fields of yellow&mdash;crops and animals must roam, tiny as specks of dust from the highway&mdash;surround tiny, colorful houses of red and brown and blue, and they fade to gray as they curve up into mountains. The mountains crouch low in the distance wherever one looks, always just a little wispy underneath a thin layer of clouds.
<br>
<br>
Periodically, a mosque appears. Dusk rolls gold light around their upside-down wine glass roofs, and they cast long shadows down the sides of the hills upon which they stand. They certainly look the part as houses of Allah. Unlike the neighborhoods of small, sturdy houses that group together across the land, the mosques stand alone. All of the windows of the rental car are down and the wind drums against the upholstery and her arms, and somewhere underneath the noise, she counts the number of mosques she passes out loud.
