    Section I

Heatwaves dance and distort the road behind them like a wormhole flying by on the highway, always hovering just a mile ahead of a car zipping down through the valley. The road stretches miles ahead and slims down as it plunges into a singular dot on the horizon line. To both sides of the highway are massive expanses of dirt plains that fold under scrubby green hills onto which square wooden houses are perched. Fields of yellow –– crops and animals must roam, tiny as specks of dust from the highway –– surround these tiny, colorful houses of red and brown and blue, and they fade to gray as they curve up into mountains. The mountains crouch low in the distance wherever one looks, always just a little wispy underneath a thin layer of clouds.

Periodically, a mosque appears. Dusk rolls gold light around their upside-down wine glass roofs, and they cast long shadows down the sides of the hills upon which they stand. They certainly look the part as houses of Allah. Unlike the neighborhoods of small, sturdy houses that group together across the land, the mosques stand alone. All of the windows of the rental car are down and the wind drums against the upholstery and her arms, and somewhere underneath the noise, she counts the number of mosques she passes out loud. 

She loses track as she rolls into a gas station. Two men in uniform trot up to her windows. 

“Abla, Merhaba,” the one with the bushier moustache says. “Just a fill-up?”

“Yes, thank you,” Erva says in cautious, mediocre Turkish.

The men begin to yell at each other in the same way soccer players on the field will alert each other to their positions and to potential tactical moves –– lots of “Ali, get over here and hold this up!” and “Someone go punch this in!” and “Take care of that gentleman over there!” The attendants buzz like bees around her car. 

“So, where are you headed?” one of the younger attendants asks. Erva leans out the window and slings her elbows against the door. 

“Didim,” she says. 

“Ah! Visiting or heading home?” 

“Just visiting.” 

“Well, you will enjoy it,” he says. “The weather is great, and they have great beaches.” 

“Where are you coming from? I hear some accent,” the moustached attendant says. Then he shakes his head. “Hold on, let us guess! Also, cash or card?”

“Card, please,” Erva says. 

“German,” says the younger attendant. 

“British,” moustache says. “It must be British. I’m confident.” 

“United States,” Erva says somberly.

“Ah! So close,” moustache says. “Abla, thank you. Would you like some tea?” 

“Oh, no thank you,” Erva says, but moustache is already turning towards his inferior, shaking his head.

“Did you not offer our friend some tea yet? For shame,” he says. The younger attendant shakes his head in agreement and opens his mouth to apologize. 

“No, no, it’s okay!” Erva laughs. “I need to go soon, anyways.” 

“Just one cup of tea! No? Well, I suppose you’re right if you want to make good time to Didim.” The moustache man gives the roof of her car a pat. 

“Have a safe trip,” the younger attendant says and sneaks a little smile onto his face before his superior might notice. Erva smiles at the men; brothers to her solely in this pocket of time and space and nowhere else. 

Erva and the rental car begin the final leg of the trip to Didim just as the sun begins to set. Before long, the road begins to wind up into the mountains. In the horizon, a deep, clear indigo begins to blossom from the last layer of the day’s sunlight. Stars begin to freckle the sky and new textures emerge: darker spots, little black bruises against the dark blue into which the stars fade out. It is the clearest sky that Erva has seen in years, and she slows the rental car to a crawl. The sky is too wonderful to ignore –– it looks like every starry scene that has ever been printed on the cover of a nature magazine.

**information to be provided here is: a) the apartment building her dad owns in didim is going to undergo renovations and leyla has been vague but bc she’s family they don’t want to call someone else to check on her b) leyla used to take care of erva when she was young bc dad was always busy with something**

It has been over a decade since she’s been on this road. Her father used to drive the car silently as Erva gazed out the passenger window, and then in Didim they would park in the street before walking up the stairs of the apartment building owned by her grandfather. Leyla, the woman from next door and a distant relative to Erva, would bring over a big pot of cold green beans doused in olive oil and tomatoes and then say goodnight. Erva and her father would eat their housewarming dinner and go to sleep, and then wake up the next day to adjust to summer life. 

As her father did remote work and drove out of town to visit nearby friends and family, Erva would be left behind with Leyla. 

“I don’t like Leyla,” Erva said, on more than one occasion as she sat with her father in the evening in the living room of the apartment.

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. I just don’t like her.” 

“While we’re in Turkey, speak in Turkish, Erva,” her father said. “She takes care of you and feeds you during the day, and she is your family. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like her, because you love her.” 

Sometimes she would try a different strategy. He watched soccer games on the TV in the evenings when he was home, and she would dutifully sit beside him as he did, saying things like, “Offsides!” and carefully watching for his reaction from the corner of her eye, something he never gave much of. 

“When is Baba coming back?” Erva asked frequently on any given day. 

“The evening,” Leyla would respond. “Be patient. Besides, we went to the beach today and you got ice cream. You had a fun day!”

Erva privately disagreed. It might have been fun if her actual parent had been there. Leyla was a prop that loosely fulfilled the necessary role of a guardian, a random pair of eyes to ensure that Erva didn’t choke on a popsicle stick or get swept away with the tide. She barely even checked those boxes. 



Now for the first time, Erva is alone on this road to Didim. When she arrives, she will have to go to the apartment building––now mostly clear of residents––and check that everyone has left as they said they would. In particular, she must check on Leyla, who has not been responsive to her father’s requests to move out of the apartment. The apartment is scheduled for imminent demolition and renovation. 

The car finds itself on a section of the road next to which a sparse set of wooden stakes make up the only barrier between drivers and a steep cliffside drop. Erva inches along until the road widens and eventually begins the decline into the other side of the mountain. 

Section II

… 

At 10PM, she rolls into Didim. The highway merges into a local road that runs along a beachside cliff –– the waves must be beautiful in the daytime. The local road becomes narrow and gravely, and she catches the faintest whiff of recognition as she turns onto a short drive lined with trees that dangle red flowers. 

The hotel is a tall building, checkered white and brown to separate the balconies of different rooms. The name of the hotel is splayed on a large sign that extends across the entrance, and on the front porch, a group of men in soccer jerseys and jean shorts smoke and drink tea. A woman in platform sandals and bleached blonde hair emerges from inside with a giant bowl of watermelon, and she’s the first to notice Erva’s car idling down the road. She steps off of the porch and waves. The men behind her crank their necks back to see. 

Erva’s hands flutter over the wheel in a brief panic. The creeper, caught. She steadies one hand over the gearshift and grips, and then moves very slowly forward to come to a stop in front of the hotel. A highly attentive audience greets her with stares and smiles. 

“Merhaba!” the woman says. “Can I help you?”  

“Selam!” Erva calls through the window. “I have a room for the night. Where can I park?” 

“Ah, Aydem Hanimi,” says one of the men on the porch. “Welcome! You can park right around there.” 

He gestures around the side of the building but one of his comrades has already hopped down the stairs to the front of her car. 

“Come right along here,” he says. 

“Omer will show you!” the man from the porch says. “Then come in, and we’ll check you in. It’s good to see you! How’s your father? Would you take any tea?” 

“Um, no thank you!” Erva shouts as she drives slowly beside Omer, who jogs her around the building to the lot. 

She parks and Omer moves to her trunk. “Do you have any suitcases or bags?” 

“Just one small one in the back!” she calls through the passenger window. She opens up the door to the backseat and swings her tiny suitcase (why on earth did she bring a half-empty suitcase when her backpack would have done the trick?) outside.

“Let me grab that for you,” Omer says. 

“Oh, no, I couldn’t, it’s so small,” Erva says. 

“Please, I insist!” Omer does indeed insist. 

“No, no, it’s really alright,” Erva says. “Thank you!” 

Omer raises his eyebrows. “Okay, if you’re sure!” 

Omer escorts her to the front desk, behind which a very small boxy TV plays a pixelated soccer game. One of the men from the porch appears, takes a good long look at the state of the game, and then turns his attention to Erva. Erva drops her suitcase to the ground, and Omer promptly picks it up.

“You’ve already paid,” the man behind the desk notes, checking a computer. “Great! We have a great pool out back, very clean and large. My name is Cem. If you have any problems, let me know. If I’m not here, the front desk is staffed 24 hours a day so Omer or Bulent or one of the other men will help you. Breakfast and dinner can be included for an extra 10TL a day. Breakfast is tea, coffee, fresh pastries, jams, butter, cheese, and a daily selection of fruit, and is from 8AM to 10AM. The dinner menu is announced at 5PM daily, and dinner is served 6PM to 8PM.

“Sounds good?” he asks. “Good! Here is your key, and Omer will take you up to your room. Please, once you’re settled in, consider coming down to join us for some tea.” 

He points to the porch. “My wife Nilay, my nephew Bulent, a few neighbors. We also have watermelon and some leftover bogrek from dinner.” 

“I’m coming from the United States,” Erva says in Turkish that her father would undoubtedly dub as no good. “So, the time. You see. The time. Everyone there has been sleeping for seven hours.” 

“The time difference?” the man confirms. “Of course, please rest! We would love to hear how your family is doing soon. No matter, another night. You’re here for a week, after all. Please say hello to him from Cem and Nilay!”

In the elevator, Erva nods at the suitcase that Omer holds onto. 

“So,” she says. “In the end, it’s yours.” 

Omer grins. “If only you had given it to me in the first place, we wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble!” 

**transition**

Erva wakes up feeling refreshed and ready for the day. Unfortunately, it is only around 3:30AM. She lays awake in bed, listening to the sounds of dying parties outside, heavy bass music that rumbles alone without the shouts and laughter of a crowd. The electric companies in Didim have special task forces dedicated solely to the stereo systems of bars by the beach –– the music never stops, does it? It’s something that Erva remembers from her childhood days spent in the city, and the nostalgia numbs any bother she has with the incessant, upbeat sounds of pop music playing in the distance as she tries to fall asleep. 

No, her real issue is this bed. It’s too squashy, and these pillows are too large. She tries tossing them to the side and putting her head directly down on the bed. No, this is awkward. She puts an arm under her neck. That is too warm. 

There was a summer they spent in Didim in their little apartment just around the corner from this hotel. Erva couldn’t sleep for the first few nights and was irritable during the day. One late night, she woke up and decided to try to read a book she had brought on the trip. She turned her lamp on and a few minutes later, her father was at her door. 

“Go to sleep,” he grunted. 

“I can’t,” Erva whispered, although there was no one to wake up. 

“I said, go to sleep.”

In a rare moment of rebellion, Erva waited a few minutes before turning her lamp on again and opening her book to the dog-eared page. The lamplight didn’t shine so far into the hallway that it could possibly bother her father –– logically, there was no problem.

The door opened and Erva’s father walked in. Erva shoved the book underneath the covers and under her legs, and as she tried to say “Sorry” her father grabbed her arm and squeezed. 

“What did I say?” 

The white curtains fluttered delicately in an incoming breeze as though a ghost had crept in through the window. The room smelled like flowers and salt. 

He dropped her arm and walked back out of the room, leaving the door open behind him. Erva laid her back straight down and closed her eyes. The book under her covers was bulky and one hard corner poked into her thigh, but she didn’t adjust right away. She didn’t pull the book out until the morning, when she woke up to find that her father had already gone down to his beach to swim. While he was gone, she dropped the book into her bedside drawer and went into the kitchen to eat breakfast and watch the morning news, which discussed last night’s World Cup game.

Erva wonders whatever happened to that book. It wasn’t particularly interesting––or maybe it had lost its flavor midway through––and she had never opened up her drawer to pick it up again. Would her father tell her, if she asks? In the hotel bed, she looks at the fan on the ceiling and shakes her head. 

After finding what seems to be the perfect position, a mosquito descends into her ear, whining in warning of its imminent landing. Erva slaps the side of her head, and then checks her palm: clear, no fatalities recorded at this time. She flaps her hands around her ears as she stands up and makes her way to the window to close it. The room goes silent, and very warm soon after. 

**some more stuff here i just dn’t feel like continuing to write this part lol**

**transition**

Section III

“Good morning,” says an unfamiliar man sitting at the front desk the next morning. 

“Good morning,” Erva says. 

It’s 8AM. Beach towns are filled with people who lounge, but they don’t come in until later in the afternoon. There’s an early one –– a salt-and-pepper man in a clean button-down shirt on his porch, smoking a morning cigarette with a bowl of olives and tomatoes in front of him, lazily watching the street and the sky. In the afternoon, surely there will be more of his kin, leaning against buildings and motorcycles, striking up conversations with the shop owners that they know, smoking cigarettes under the shade of streetside ice cream vendors. 

For now, the few people who are outside are people who are going somewhere. There is a purpose to the bag in their hands –– some are coming from the supermarket carrying groceries, others are carrying linen packs streaked in sand as they come back from early morning swims. Erva keeps an eye on the latter. 

“Walk as though you’re heading to the boardwalk. Through that one neighborhood beside our apartment, you remember? Then down the street, there’s that cliffside and when you look down, you see a little closed-in beach. There should be a set of stairs somewhere nearby. You will see.”

This is part of the grander speech her father gives her on the phone a few days before she flies out to Didim. It’s not important. Her father was the one who always went swimming at this particular beach, and far too early in the morning. 

More tension w/ her dad

“You get there before the sun is directly overhead! It’s beautiful. You missed out, all those years,” the voice comes over the phone. The tone he uses is so authoritative and formal. It doesn’t quite match with what he says in regards to the beach. The rest of the phone call, sure. Serious topic, serious tone. But he does apply it to everything he does. 

“Baba, maybe you should go,” Erva says. “You could use the trip more than me.”

“No,” her father says. “You deserve the sunshine.” 

Erva finds the beach as per her father’s directions. It’s not as difficult as she thought it would be to find. The route comes naturally to her, and the sights are familiar –– there is the overly weedy yard of a corner house behind a rusted fence, there is the kiddy rollercoaster with ladybug cars in the beachside theme park further down the road. The theme park looks like a discarded toy in the daylight, large, pinkish, plastic and perfectly still. There is the neighborhood dumpster, and there is the occasional cat that wanders past. Each cat gives Erva one meaningful look before slinking behind a bush and disappearing.

Her beach. Passed down from father to daughter. The sentiment is helped by the fact that she sees no one else at this tiny, secluded place as she first heads down the stony stairway from atop the cliff to the water. 

**more stuff here for setting scene**
**then a little while later**

“Erva hanim, good morning!” calls Cem, the hotel owner. He stands on the front porch drinking tea from a tiny glass cup. Even under the shade of the trees and the extended porch canopy, the thin crust of dried salt and sand on Erva’s skin begins to crack because of how intensely Erva sweats. She blots her forehead with the neck of her shirt, wondering how Cem can sit comfortably in an unbuttoned sweater vest over a button down shirt and full length khakis. 

“Good morning!” Erva says. 

“Did you sleep well? Are you enjoying your stay so far? Is there anything I can do for you?”

“I slept well, the room is comfortable,” Erva says. “Thank you.” 

“That’s very good to hear,” Cem says. “Would you like some tea?” 

“I haven’t, ah, given money yet,” Erva stutters. “For food in the morning.” 

Cem waves away her terrible Turkish and with the same hand, gestures for her to take a seat at one of the lawn chairs on the porch. Erva’s embarrassment over butchering this man’s native language turns to a burning sense of responsibility for recompense and she sits down. “No need. Omer’s bringing out more tea, I’ll ask him to bring one more cup. Omer!”

He knocks on the window behind them. “Another cup! Erva hanim is joining us!” 

“So, Erva,” he says, settling comfortably into his chair. “You went to the beach this morning?”

“Yes,” Erva says. “If I go this early, there’s no one else there. It’s beautiful.” 

“Of course, of course,” Cem says. “You know, we get many British tourists here, and all of them go to the big beach down the road, do you know the one? It’s just across the Migros. They all go there, pay for chairs and umbrellas, and become red all over –– the faces are just, boof! –– and then come back for dinner. Is that the one you go to?”

“When I was little, I went there in the afternoons with an abla,” Erva says. “This morning, I went to a small place. It’s next to the…” 

Erva twists her hands around. “I can’t remember the word. Like a lot of cars, in the air…”

She mimics the motion of a wave with her hand. 

“Ah! Lunaparki?” 

“Yes, yes, lunapark!” Erva says, leaning forward. “Yes. It’s by there.” 

“You know, Omer knows some English. If he comes out here, you can try speaking with him,” the old man says. 

Years ago, it was her father growling at her to “Say it correctly.” when she tried to speak his native tongue in their house in the United States to tell him thank you for cooking a delicious dinner. She stood at the edge of the kitchen island, face beginning to flush, the homework in her room forgotten. She tried again. He shook his head and his voice a lick angrier: “Say it correctly.” And so they went back and forth, the anger in his voice growing like the tongues of a flame leaping higher into the sky, until Erva managed to say thank you correctly. He said it back to her, and turned to the dishwasher. Erva took small, slow steps to leave the kitchen, and then ran to her bedroom once out of sight. 

Today, this stranger kindly attempts to offer some comfort for Erva, who is far from home. Erva smiles at Cem. “Maybe later.” 


Section IV

On Friday morning, Erva wakes up early to go swimming again. It’s a hot day from the get go. Heat swings in the air like a pendulum as early morning breezes cut and push around humidity. Erva can feel it as the line of sweat popping up at her hairline, and smell it in the scent of roses and dead weeds baking along the sidewalks. 


3/13 one thing that occurs to me is that I’m super apprehensive of doing anything that I don’t think is going to be good, which is so dumb and contradictory to the editing process. Obviously there is going to be quite a bit of things that I don’t organize well the first time. There’s no telling ahead of time that they’re not organized well, either –– I can only see that once I have all the parts ready to go at the end, and I realize they’re all out of order, or that some parts don’t have quite enough mass, or some parts have too much. I need to get over this roadblock in my head that keeps me in one spot, thinking about if I start writing part X, then I could do this and this and that and this. But on the other hand, I could write X and then immediately write Y, and then do this and that and this. But…. So many ‘but’s and so little ‘okay, let’s move onto the next section’s! 

***

In the evening, Erva visits the boardwalk. She takes the same route she would to go to her father’s beach, except this time takes a left to turn onto a main road. There’s a low stone wall that extends alongside the side of the road, and on the other side is a rocky hillside that eventually dips into the ocean below. At 8PM, the sun is in the process of slowly sinking into the ocean at the horizon line, leaving a lovely burnt orange flare in its wake. The Greek Islands are translucent over the ocean, just lightly drawn outlines somewhere far out. Closer to the boardwalk, there’s an unmoving circle in the sky of the neon pink lights of a ferris wheel. 

The road slopes downward and eventually winds into the storefronts that open up the boardwalk. The smell of salt is everywhere: the crunchy seaweed washed up on the beach, the kebabs on their spinning poles, the grilled fish sandwiches with steak fries on the side. 

At the Kar Cicegi restaurant, Erva orders iced tea and lahmacun. 

“Why don’t you get ayran?” asked the woman from next door, once upon a time when Erva was small. 

“I don’t like it,” Erva told her.

“Have you ever tried it?” she asked incredulously.

Erva looked over her shoulder at the ocean, just past the edge of the boardwalk. An ice cream vendor with a red hat in the shape of a bucket with a golden tassel swinging atop it stood there. With tongs the length of his own arms, he took scoops of ice cream and popped them into cones and dipped them in chocolate and nuts. 

“Erva, have you ever tried ayran?” the woman asked again, this time very seriously. 

“No,” she muttered, now looking down at her plaid pink bermuda shorts, smudged with sand. 

“Well then, how can you say you don’t like it?” 

“It looks weird,” she said. “It’s too watery to be yogurt, and it’s too thick to be a drink.” 

“Those are not good reasons to not try it,” the woman said, and puts a finger in the air. “Kardes, can we get another ayran?”

A plastic cup with a crinkly aluminum top was placed on the tabletop and Erva looked away in disgust. 

“Just try it,” Leyla says. “I don’t ask anything more from you but to try it, and you know me! I would never ask anything from you that I don’t think would be good for you or that you would like.”

Leyla, nearly sixty years old, was thin and covered in sharp angles. Her collarbones poked out from underneath her flowery button-down and her knees were tanned and knobby. She wore pink lipstick –– the same shade every day –– and dyed her hair a dark, rust red. She pushed the cup of ayran closer to Erva’s side of the table. 

“Go ahead,” she said. “It won’t hurt you to just try it.” 

Erva stayed very still and kept her eyes pointed at the folded napkin in front of her. If she didn’t move, she would eventually become so small and disintegrate into a nothing being, a thing that wouldn’t be able to drink ayran, or anything else for that matter. If she could just cease to exist for that moment, Leyla abla would become uninterested, like a toothy animal reviewing what may or may not be prey playing dead. 

“Erva, why won’t you try the ayran? Try it for me,” the woman implored. 

Allah, please, Erva said in her head without blinking – if she blinked, she would unwillingly push out the excess tears beginning to gather in her eyes. Please please please, I will never ask for anything ever again, I just don’t want ayran. 

Leyla, oblivious, tried to ask her once more. “Go ahead, Erva, the nice server brought over this ayran, just go ahead and try it.” 

Erva began to cry. And because she had been holding them back, they flooded forward in one big splash across her nose. 

“Erva? Are you okay?” Leyla asked. “My girl, what is wrong? Are you feeling okay?” 

Erva cried harder. A young couple at the neighboring table looked over and the woman asked, “Is she okay?” 

Leyla shook her head, flabbergasted. “I don’t understand what happened. She’s just crying for some reason.” 

Erva, a small speck floating further and further away from Earth, covered her eyes with her hands. Leyla tried to pull her hands away from her face. 

“Let me see your face,” she said, swiping her thumbs underneath Erva’s eyes. “What’s wrong? Look me in the eyes. What’s wrong?” 

Erva had no other choice but to return to reality and look Leyla in the face. With snot running in salty streams along the edges of her lips, she whispered, “I don’t want to drink ayran.” 

Leyla stared at her for a moment with her mouth slightly ajar. Erva could see the pale, wrinkled underbelly of her painted pink lips. Then Leyla began to laugh and Erva looked away again, back towards the ice cream vendor. 

“What an incredibly silly thing to cry about,” Leyla chuckled. “I didn’t know you would cry! Fine then, don’t drink it, if you’re going to be so dramatic.” 

The couple at the table over smiled and nodded and went back to their own lunch. At some point, a server quietly insisted that something was “On the house, don’t worry, don’t worry” as Leyla tried to argue, and a Magnum ice cream bar quietly appeared in front of Erva. 

It took years for Erva to even bother to taste ayran, and she only did it in the safety of the cafeteria of an international grocery store near her apartment in the States. It was the same brand as the one Leyla had offered her years ago. She poked a straw through the lid and before taking a sip, spun on her heel to give the cafeteria a once-over. No one else but a man wearing a sweater vest, drinking a black coffee over a plastic box of tuna salad, staring forcefully at the newspaper laid out in front of him. Her corner table, stained with mustard and chipped along the edges, was sufficiently private. She drank a little bit, and then downed the full cup soon after. She liked it. It was delicious. 

She will not order it at the Kar Cicegi tonight, though, as she watches the sun slide down the darkening sky. Her iced tea is peach flavored and cold and is just fine as a complement to the slightly burned lahmacun served to her. After finishing dinner, she walks down the boardwalk, telling herself that on a different day, she’ll get ice cream. She wonders what Leyla is eating for dinner right now, just a mile or two away.  

3/14 i worry that i’m going to write all of this stuff about didim down and bottle up my major memories while effectively trimming away so many smaller things. Shoutout to the Corona Virus because I Don’t KnoW When I’ll Go Back to Didim !!!!

3/15 don’t get super anchored into one specific tone/theme/whatever until everything has been written. Also what is erva thinking all this time?? Do it similar to how she ‘think’s about language –– keep it subtle but also it’s not overpowering rn so you can do more of it 

3/16 I really need to introduce Leyla earlier in the piece. Don’t know how but I really need to lol

Section V

On Friday morning, Erva wakes up early. The jetlag has nothing to do with it. Her stomach, full of butterflies and acid, gives her a cramp and her eyes open at 5:30AM. She shuts them. There is a lot to do today. Today is the only day that really matters during this trip.

At 6AM, she gives up trying to sleep and crawls over to the other side of the bed where her suitcase sits open on the ground. The clothing she has brought on the trip hangs neatly in the hotel room closet, so the single item still residing inside the suitcase looks like the single actor on a large, dark stage: an envelope, slightly bent out of shape. It’s barely sealed, having been haphazardly slicked shut with a wet pinkie multiple times.

“I also sent it in email format,” Erva’s father had said helpfully on the phone when Erva first received the physical note in her mailbox. “In case you lose it.” 

“I haven’t lost anything while traveling in years, Baba,” Erva sighed. 

“I’m going to be busy and I won’t be able to give you all of the information in this much detail at the drop of a hat. Don’t lose it.” 

“I won’t,” she said. “It’s important. I wouldn’t lose it.” 

“I can’t just fly over there on a whim, you know,” Erva’s father lectured on. Erva sunk into her living room sofa as her knuckles grew white around the phone. “You are the one that’s going to talk to Leyla. You are the one that’s going to pick up the keys. You are the last person to go into the apartment.”

“What about the demolition guys?”

“What?”

“I’m not going to be the last person in there. One of them will be.” 

“Erva, don’t be funny.” 

In Turkish, Erva said: “I’m saying real. I can do this.” 

Her father laughed. “You should brush up on your Turkish before you go.”

In the hotel room, she opens up the envelope again, careful not to tear the paper. It bothers her that her father doesn’t take her seriously when she tries, and then takes her too seriously when she doesn’t. It bothers her that whenever they speak, it’s like she’s communicating with someone via Google Translate; the gist of the message is there, but there’s no perception of tone on either side. 

The note inside the envelope is a plain piece of printer paper and contains a list of instructions her father has written down. Unlike his speech, his handwriting is loopy and expressive. At the very top, there’s an underlined section that he’s written in large letters: 

TODO on Friday!

***

3/17 I am sitting in the law quad and the weather is so nice and I love how so many people are outside now and my head is literally floating and I cannot concentrate for the life of me !! must continue. I worry that i’m never going to arrive at the conflict i’m *trying* to build up to but i just need to DO it and then i can go back and figure out if it’s right or not 

**ok skipping a bunc here, now it’s midday and my girl is about to go talk to leyla**

From downtown, Erva walks up and down the street mindlessly window shopping until one of the city minibuses appears, chugging and huffing exhaust all the way down to its stop. She drops 10TL into the driver’s hand. He smokes a cigarette and wears a wifebeater, and the bus jolts off before Erva has a chance to sit down. A pair of stuffed dominoes swing dangerously from the rearview mirror as the bus starts and stops and careens around corners. Erva clutches the upholstery of the seat in front of her in order to not get thrown into the aisle, where sweaty British tourists talk about where they should go to get beers. A few Turkish people try yelling at the bus driver occasionally to ask how long it would take to get to stop 42, or to stop 13, and he never responds. 

“Abi, do you hear us back here?” comes one irritated voice from the middle of the bus. 

The bus driver pretends he can’t hear them. Through the window, Erva sees her stop coming up. 

“My stop, my stop,” she says, eyeing the aisle, packed with people. No one seems to pay attention. Her voice rises in a squeaky panic. “Can you stop? Hey, abi, can you stop?” 

The bus breaks abruptly, launching every passenger an inch or two up and forward into the air. Someone swears, and Erva squeezes her way to the front of the bus, where she pops out and onto the sidewalk. Before she can say thank you, the doors close behind her and the bus takes off. 

In front of the bus stop is a short row of houses. Around the corner is the apartment building her father owns and is planning to sell to some hotel chain Erva doesn’t know the name of. It’s where Leyla lives and now waits for Erva to take away the keys to her home. 

She knows that the bus will return in seven minutes to this stop. She considers turning her back on the neighborhood behind her and plopping down onto the curb to wait. The consequent events are predictable and appealing: she boards the bus and gets off at a beach or a local restaurant, she goes home, she ignores the WhatsApp messages from her father, she flies back to her quiet apartment in the United States. 

Her brain goes further: obviously, she can’t just not go to the apartment building. Perhaps if she never had even volunteered, snatching up the opportunity from an offhand comment from her father three months ago, she wouldn’t be standing here at this moment saddled with this responsibility. It wasn’t like she was the only person capable of walking over and being handed a set of dusty old keys. If she just hadn’t heard him sigh and grumble about having to fly out to Turkey in the middle of a merger, if she just hadn’t let her mouth open up and say that she actually would have plenty of time in the summer since her fellowship would end.

Too bad retrospect lends itself to nothing but regret. Erva walks away from the bus stop and to the apartment building. In the alcove around the front door, Leyla sits in a plastic white chair with a bottle of ayran and a comically large pair of sunglasses on her face. 

“Erva!” Leyla calls out. Her voice is raspy, and Erva remembers with a start that Leyla was a heavy smoker. 

“Merhaba!” Erva says in English. “Leyla, how are you?” 

“I can’t believe how much you have grown,” Leyla says, looking Erva up and down as Erva reaches the front steps. “The last time I saw you, you were just this tall.” 

**here leyla should say something to the effect of “your dad couldn’t tell me when you were coming in, did you hear anything from him? I wanted to have dinner with you and show you around” and erva lies and says “oh no he didn’t say so” and then w/ some more derision “i’ve been here before, you know, i could check things out on my own”**

Leyla gestures with her hand for a moment, and then stands up to embrace Erva. They kiss each other’s cheeks and Erva catches the whiff of cigarettes and citrusy perfume. Leyla grips Erva’s shoulders tightly with thin, bony fingers. When she steps back to hold Erva at a distance, Erva can see that she looks even thinner than she was. Leyla smiles at Erva with the same shade of pink lipstick that she wore decades ago. 

“How are you now? Are you still in school, or are you working?” Leyla asks and turns towards the front door. “Come inside!” 

“Um, yes,” Erva says. “Leyla, is there somewhere to sit inside?”

“Of course, of course, what are you even saying?” Leyla says, sticking a key into the front door. A key that should be retired by now. 

“I, um,” Erva flounders, taking a step forward and stopping. “Sh… Um…” 

Erva decides to give up on any preliminary critiques. The concern she has might be based on nothing. Maybe there’s a final old plastic table and set of chairs in what used to be Leyla’s unit, the only pieces of furniture left and easily dispensable. She could even help Leyla, who looks particularly frail and now holds a walking stick, take them outside and put them on the curb. She could call Cem, from the hotel –– the hotel staff might appreciate an extra old table and chairs for the front porch. 

She follows Leyla up the stone steps to the first floor, where Leyla inserts a second key into her unit’s door. Erva bites hard down on her lower lip and tastes salt in her mouth. Leyla gives the door a concentrated shove in a spot just above the keyhole and it gives way into a fully furnished living room. Erva’s stomach clenches and she steps over the threshold. 

“My shoes,” she says. “I’ll leave them?” 

“It doesn’t matter,” Leyla says, tapping the floor with the toe of her sneaker. She’s in the kitchen and turns the stove on in order to boil a kettle of water. The glassdoor cabinets above the sink are stacked with plates and bowls. There’s a small wooden table just beyond the counter, surrounded by several blue chair stools. Picture frames of black and white landscapes hang from the peeling yellow wallpaper, and there’s a rug in the kitchen and peeking out from the living room. The entire apartment is filled with sunlight: it streams through the gauzy white curtains around the living room windows. 

Erva’s head begins to hurt. What a complete and utter disaster. 

It’s not her fault. Her father should have been the one to tell Leyla that she was supposed to have moved out weeks ago. Regardless, she is the one that is here now, standing in the fully furnished apartment. She is the one that has to deal with it. The building has to come down anyways. Maybe it will all be okay if she can just get Leyla and several of her most prized possessions out in time for demolition. The rubble will be cleared whether or not it contains broken table legs and dinner plates.


3/25 ok so one thing i was thinking about was that it makes no sense for anyone to be collecting keys regardless of what’s happening to the apartment building, so i’ve decided i’m going to go ahead and enrich the plot line a little -- i thought i could get away w/ making it super simple but i’m realizing now i have to make this make sense in a different way. I will have to go back and make it so that erva is here to get the building in order for **not demolition** repurposing (??what’s the word for changing a building from apartment to mega single family house) 

In fact, let’s have the dad’s whole thing here be that he wants to completely repurpose the apartment building into a big house for himself to retire in! Ok that’s actually pretty good because then we can draw parallels between him coming to didim to retire and leyla coming to didim to retire, and the house’s whole thing involved in it 
Ok well anyways while i figure that out, let’s get into the conversation between them 
Wait ok i just had a thought. How about the dad is like ‘someone needs to go check out the building to see if there are any issues w/ it so i can plan for what kinds of renovations to do’ and erva is like ‘i’ll go!’ and the dad is like ‘ok great everyone should have moved out by now but i haven’t received leyla’s key yet so just go talk to her’  


“Go on, sit down wherever you would like to,” Leyla says. Erva trudges over to the living room, where she can see the balcony stained with fallen mulberries through the curtains. 

“Your tea is ready,” Leyla calls from the kitchen. “Don’t let an old, pained woman serve you everything, Erva. Come get your tea and serve us both some cookies –– check the cabinet on the left.” 

Erva stands up and goes to the kitchen to pull out a tin of cookies from the left cabinet and pick up her cup and saucer. Her frustration is growing behind her eyelids. 

“Thank you, Erva,” Leyla says as they sit down at the living room coffee table. “Now, tell me, how are you? What are you doing these days all the way over there in America?”

Leyla’s face is shining painfully. Erva takes an overly large swallow of her tea and it burns her tongue. 

“Last year I quit work,” she says. “I want to go to law school so I am planning on that now.” 

“Ah! Law! I remember you used to love reading,” Leyla laughs. “You had such thick books for a ten year old. I remember telling your dad that you needed to get out of those books and out into the world to learn something real. But I suppose it worked out for you, in the end, all that reading. You know I used to work with lawyers? I know something about how that profession works. If you ever have any questions, you let me know.” 

Erva smiles weakly.

“What else? Tell me about your friends. Where will you go for school?”

“My friends are good,” Erva says. “I haven’t applied yet, but I want Columbia. In New York.” 

“Oh, New York, how nice,” Leyla says. “That is somewhere I have never been. I have visited San Diego and Chicago but never New York. While you’re there, I can visit and we can explore the city together!”

Erva smiles and nods. “Leyla, one thing I need to talk to you about.” 

“Have you had a cookie? This is the kind you loved when you were just this tall!” Leyla holds her hand out to demonstrate once more. “It’s the one with chocolate cream in the middle. You loved them. Eat one.” 

“I don’t want it, really,” Erva tries, but the woman fishes a cookie out of its cylindrical tin and holds it in front of Erva anyways. Erva picks it up and crumbles off a piece of the edge to pop in her mouth. 

“No, no, like this,” Leyla says. She snaps a fresh one in half and dunks it into her tea. “Delicious. This is how we used to eat them all the time, when I was a child.” 

“Okay,” Erva says. “Leyla, really. My dad sent me here.” 

“You’re too skinny,” Leyla says. “There’s a big bowl of green beans in the fridge, would you like some of that?”

Erva stares as Leyla stands up to slowly make her way back to the kitchen. Leyla rummages through the kitchen, and Erva wonders if she should call her father. 

“Well, there’s not as much as I thought there was,” Leyla calls out, placing the bowl on the kitchen counter. “But have as much as you would like!” 

“Leyla, why are you still here?” 

Leyla turns around. “What do you mean?”

“Didn’t you hear anything from my father?”

Leyla shakes her head, not in any sort of affirmative answer but as though she’s trying to clear it out. She smiles again and sits down at the kitchen table. “Yes.”

“But you’re still here.”

Leyla continues to smile. “Yes.” 

“Why?” 

“This is my house.” 

Erva laughs. “No, it’s not.” 

“Yes, it is.” 

Erva’s head feels as though it is floating a few inches above the rest of her body. “Leyla, my dad is going to demolish the building. You can’t be here.” 

The switch flips and Leyla’s eyebrows screw down. “This is my house. You can’t just take this away from me. I have lived here for thirty something years. I don’t bother anyone and I pay rent.”

Her face hardens a shade more and she looks towards the window. “I took care of you for years for no cost at all to your father. I never asked for anything in return but he certainly never thought to give anything. And now he just wants to take something from me again. Your grandfather would never treat me like this.” 

Erva stares at the table in front of her. There are two cookie crumbs sitting on the edge and she glues her eyes to them. 

Leyla turns back towards Erva. “I took care of you when your father wouldn’t bother. And now he sends you off to kick me out of my own house. The audacity of that man.” 

“He didn’t send me,” Erva says. Her voice cracks. “I wanted to come.” 

Leyla ignores this and makes a fist against the kitchen tabletop. She bangs down. She’s too weak to make much of a noise, but Erva still flinches. 

“It’s my house,” Leyla says again. “My house!”

Leyla continues to chant to herself and Erva sits on the sofa, miserably staring at the crumbs in front of her. 

The words are all in her head. They’re not jumbled; she knows what she could say to make it better. I’m sorry! It’s awful to be forced to leave the place you’ve called home for such a long time, and by a family member, no less. But it’s going to be alright, Abla. There are so many other places to stay in Didim, so many other fantastic little apartment units right by the sea. Some probably in better locations than this one –– this one is, after all, quite a walk from the Migros. Also, between you and I, Baba isn’t going to retire anytime soon. I’m not sure he ever will. In any case, once the apartment is renovated to become a beautiful multi-level house, you can live here Leyla! There will always be a room in the new house for you, Leyla!

It occurs to Erva that she could go beyond simple consolation. Leyla, I didn’t know you felt so strongly. Let me call Baba. Maybe he can hold off on renovations. There are other properties he can retire to –– the one in Akcakoca, for example. That is also by a beach. Yes, the waves there are much more hostile and the area is often stormier than sunny but the food is great. I could try to convince him. 

Even if calling her father didn’t work, she would at least garner some sympathy from Leyla. Leyla could see Erva for the middle-woman she really is. Erva has no power here. She is just a lonely messenger. Not a very effective one, but here she is. Things could turn around and Leyla could pity Erva. After all, they have something in common: they’re at the mercy of the same man. For the briefest moment, Erva sees herself as the hero of not just her own story, but Leyla’s. 

Leyla shuffles out of sight, continuing to mumble. The bathroom door squeaks closed. Aside from the wind gently propelling the edges of the curtains high for a moment and then down again, there’s no sound or movement inside the apartment. The distant sounds of cars and motorbikes honking their horns at each other and a man selling watermelons yelling, “Watermelons!” come in through the open windows. Alone in the room, Erva brushes the cookie crumbs off of the table. 

A minute passes before the toilet flushes and Leyla walks back into the living room. She breathes heavily; the panic is setting in. 

“Please,” Leyla says, suddenly grabbing Erva’s hand. She squeezes it between her wrinkled fingers. “You can’t just let this happen to me. Erva, I was like a mother to you.” 

A surge of disgust wells up within Erva. It’s a surprising feeling, and before it can melt into shame, Erva latches onto it. The nerve of this random old woman to claim her mother’s position. Erva had been willing to be sympathetic; well, no more. She wrenches her hand away and Leyla breathes in sharply. 

“I’m not doing this to you,” Erva says. “Baba told you. You had time. If it wasn’t me here, it would have been the police.” 

A moment flashes through Erva’s head: Erva’s father telling her that she wasn’t good at communicating efficiently. “What you’re actually trying to say gets lost. Everything you try to say can be said in less than ten seconds. If it’s more, then the person in front of you is lost and disengaged.” Erva looks into Leyla’s small dark eyes and the frayed red afghan thrown against the couch behind her. Her message to Leyla is clear as day––her father might approve––and it comes as a result of her total inability to offer up distracting details that required Turkish fluency. One personal weakness alleviating another. 

3/27 this conversation sucks. i’m struggling w/ pacing + erva’s inner monologue

There’s silence in the apartment. Leyla doesn’t cry or look away from Erva’s face. 

The summer after third grade, Leyla started taking her to neighbors’ houses for social calls. It usually wasn’t awful. Just boring. There was a particular neighbor family that lived in a green house just a few buildings down from the apartment building. Erva liked these neighbors; the old man made cranberry lemon scones the few times she sat on the floor by the low coffee table in their living room as Leyla gossiped with his wife. 

“The way you make them is good, but then if you dip them into tea–” Erva once said to him conspiratorially, a chunk of pastry and cup of tea in hand to demonstrate. “They become the best.” 

“Of course,” he said. “Look, some of the sugar crust goes into the tea, too, to make the tea even better. An all-around delicious snack. You’re very smart.” 

She doesn’t remember his name now, or his wife’s name. They only went over a few times. One time, the old man was at work and Leyla left Erva alone on the porch to go inside. Erva, alone and bored, walked out into the sunny gravel road in front of the house. She scratched her ear and a heavyset bee buzzed loudly as it swooped into the weedy flower patches by the house. 

Erva decided to walk down the road. She fingered a crumpled 100TL bill stashed in the far corner of her right pocket––cash given to her from her father at the beginning of the summer––as she thought hard about which turns to take to get herself to the beach. There was a burger bar she could get ice cream from. Besides, the neighbor man wasn’t home and there was no mouthwatering smell of sugar and lemon drifting from the kitchen where Leyla and the wife sat around chatting, and Erva didn’t particularly feel like swiping extra sugar cubes when tea would inevitably be served. 

Down the gravel road she walked, a four foot child in a pink tank top and white sandals, a little sunburned around the ears. Her father walked in straight lines, with his shoulders loose and his eyes forward. Erva tried to mimic the same. Perhaps it was this confidence––so bizarrely dressed on an eight year old––that put passerby off from bothering to ask her where her parents were. 

3/29 also i am being insanely laissez faire about this lol like i know my characters + i know their personalities so i know how they will react + act about stuff, but i am really just completely making up what happens and writing things in the flow. like 0 planning ahead of what i’m doing !! not great !! the exact opposite of what everyone has said to do lol 

The next hour or two skated by. She bought ice cream from the burger bar, and then walked back up to the main road. She walked to her father’s beach and stood at the top of the cliffside staircase, looking down into the cove. Blue and white striped towels and colorful umbrellas dotted the sand. Erva blew a chunk of hair out of her eyes and glared at the strangers down below. 

And then, the part that Erva remembers most vividly: returning to the house, her fingers sticky with ice cream and her pockets jangling with change coins she didn’t understand the value of, and Leyla walking out of the front door a few minutes later to say, “Erva! Oh, you’re just out here. Have you just been sitting out here playing with the stray cats? You know that’s dangerous.” Erva, at age eight, thought herself to be some kind of sneaky genius. 

It happened more than once: Leyla going to talk to people about nothing important, and Erva being forgotten and left to her own devices. Erva, walking down main roads alone, licking an ice cream cone with her shoulders straight, ripe for potential kidnapping. 

And the person who facilitated that wants now to equate herself to a mother. Erva looks away from a very frail looking Leyla, who shrinks further and further into herself by the minute. 

3/29 weirdly this has been emotionally draining to write, even though like ….. This is all literally made up !

**erva leaves. I’ll write it later ** 

Section VI





















Writing on Leyla –– mapping stuff that Louis recommended I do w/ characters I’m having a harder time fleshing out 
Physical description
Seventy something years old, red hair, moccasins

Background 
She was once a beautiful young woman with a queue of propositions from rich handsome men, although she never capitalized on the fact in order to marry. She simply didn’t have the time or the interest. 

It wasn’t as though she was driving her life into some opposing extreme, though –– she had no plans to travel the world, or to dedicate her soul to Allah and study and teach the sacred texts, or to launching an ambitious business venture. She didn’t care for a romantic relationship. She never did, in all her years on Earth. The radio shows from her youth in which a sweet, dainty blonde doll was whisked into a fantastic adventure hand-in-hand with the rugged male star did not appeal to her in the same way it did to her dewy-eyed sisters. They would all sit by the radio in the evening after dinner, the smell of cooking fat lingering in the air from the nearby kitchen. Her sisters sat on the rug, hugging the legs of the table on which the radio sat, and Leyla sat in the corner of the nearest sofa. 

 Leyla did not desire a muscled, hairy arm to reach out to her through her bedroom window one evening and pluck her out of her summertime boredom. She did enjoy the storytelling, though. In this way, she enjoyed religion. She didn’t care for memorizing each and every prayer in order to impress the religion teacher down the road that hosted classes after school, but she respected the practices. She prayed everyday and hushed her sisters to a begrudging silence when the ezan was read over the loudspeakers. Although she had pretty curly hair that she liked to tease out before going out for a night in the town, she faithfully tucked it back into one of her mother’s pink hair wraps before going to the mosque.

Her sisters were not like this. They loved the radio shows. They loved the damsel-in-distress fantasy. Leyla’s neutral stance was enough to exclude her. Later in life, Leyla would blame the radio shows for driving a wedge between herself and her sisters. They were the first to shine a light on Leyla’s otherness. The trigger to a decade of growing apart, and the one that Leyla could always vividly recall. The other things –– favorite foods, the uneven distribution of household chores, jealousy over boys, competition over academic work, differing degrees of loyalty to Allah –– flaked away from memory as the years pushed forward. 

Leyla was not necessarily liked, but she was an integral member of her local community. Besides, if her mouth slipped to say something strange –– something a young woman wasn’t expected to say –– one of her neighbors would push a cup of tea in her face and say, “Leyla, don’t be so ridiculous. Pull yourself together. Also, you are too thin! You better finish this pogaca before I come back from the kitchen with more!” In a kind, motherly way, of course. And then Leyla would go out and join the neighborhood kids in skating down the road to buy chocolate eggs and fire poppers from the corner store. 

3/24 note -- ok so quick fact check lol not fire poppers but the sandpapery strips off of cigarette boxes

To nine-year-old Erva’s horror, Leyla told her stories of times they would glue the fire poppers to the soles of their shoes and rub their shoes on the ground until their feet began to light up. “It was fun, Erva, not like your indoor childhood,” Leyla laughed. “We were wild children.” 

Leyla moved to Didim when she was forty years old. One of her sisters died of pneumonia the year before. The corner store had been abandoned for over a decade. Leyla didn’t think too much about moving. Another sister asked her why, and then followed up to ask if it was because she was looking for a husband with a tan. 

“And I told her, I am too old to be searching for a husband,” Leyla said to little Erva. “And I was right! No husband, but I met you, and you are a very bright young woman. A very good girl.” 

Moving to Didim was a sort of retirement for Leyla. She had worked as an assistant in a law office for over a decade. She found a part-time position as a front desk clerk at a bank in Didim, but would eventually work out a schedule for herself that would allow her to quit working early –– at age 50! Being childless was the ultimate financial blessing. She indeed would end up retiring and spending her days enjoying the sun and making friends with local women. 

Erva’s grandfather was the one managing the apartment in Didim at the time. As it so happened, Leyla was related to Erva’s grandfather –– a cousin of a wife of a brother. An intricately layered relative.  He rented a unit out to Leyla –– the unit next to the one that was reserved for Erva’s extended family when anyone was in town. 

Erva’s grandfather told his son that family was staying next door when he and Erva came to stay for the summer. Someone loosely related to himself, but related nonetheless. Some men care for social stature, or for notoriety for their wealth. Erva’s grandfather only cared to be loved by his family and he would do anything for them. He told his son to be kind to Leyla, and to have her meet Erva. 

“She’s an old woman with no children,” he said to Erva’s father in private. “Poor lady. The one thing that women live for. Not even a husband to blame infertility on.” 

Leyla knew what people said about her behind closed doors. As she grew older, she found she cared less and less. After all, she was the one about to cash in on a new home by the beach. Her sister’s death left her shaking with grief and thumbing through old photos every evening for the rest of her life, but she saw it primarily as a warning: life could be cut out at any moment, so one should make sure to enjoy it.
